<h2>Intro</h2>
I have created a Rock Paper Scissors game which utilizes HTML & CSS, with the main purpose of the project to showcase the skills I have learned in the latest Code Institute module, Javascript. The game pits the user/player against the computer in a game of chance. The site's goal is to create a challenging game for the player while entertaining them online. 

The Rules:

* <b>Rock</b> beats <b>Scissors</b>
* <b>Paper</b> beats <b>Rock</b>
* <b>Scissors</b> beats <b>Paper</b>

<h2>Features</h2>
I plan to include the following features:

  * Pattern matching functionality
  * A limited number of tries before the game is over
  * A score tracking system
  * The ability to play against the computer
 
<h2>UX</h2>
 
I plan to incorporate the following in the user experience:
 * a game that is easy to understand, intuative & entertaining for the user
 * pit the user against the computer

<h2>Intro</h2>
I have created a Rock Paper Scissors game which utilizes HTML & CSS, with the main purpose of the project to showcase the skills I have learned in the latest Code Institute module, Javascript. The game pits the user/player against the computer in a game of chance. The site's goal is to create a challenging game for the player while entertaining them online. 

<h3>The Rules:</h3>

The user chooses one of three options (Rock, Paper or Scissors) & this choice is compared against the computers choice. 

* <b>Rock</b> beats <b>Scissors</b>
* <b>Paper</b> beats <b>Rock</b>
* <b>Scissors</b> beats <b>Paper</b>

The user/computer score increments by 1 each time they win & does not increment if they draw or lose a game.  The first to 10 points wins! 

<h2>Features</h2>
I plan to include the following features:

  * Pattern matching functionality
  * A limited number of tries before the game is over
  * A score tracking system
  * The ability to play against the computer
 
<h2>UX</h2>
 
I plan to incorporate the following into the user experience:

 * a game that is easy to understand, intuative & entertaining for the user
 * pit the user against the computer
 * make the game visually appealing to the user with complimentary colors, icons/emojis & call to actions
 * the game should work without any bugs or faults  

<h2>Fonts</h2>

I used [<b>Google Fonts</b>](https://fonts.google.com/) as it has a vast amount of modern & contemporary fonts. The two fonts I have used are Hind Siligur & Rubik, I felt these fonts complimented each other, where clean & modern & easily readible for the user. 

<h2>Icons</h2>

I have used a favicon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

I wanted to make the website visually appealing to the user so decided to use emojis for the selection buttons; 

* Rock ‚úä  
* Paper ‚úã  
* Scissors ‚úåÔ∏è

I used a smiling emoji (üòÅ) when the user wins & a crying emoji (üò≠) in the result description when the user loses, to add to the visual experience of the user. These were sourced from [GetEmoji](https://getemoji.com/)   

<h2>Design</h2>

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to get a complimentary color palette to add to the visual experience of the user. I used the following:

* #05445E - very dark blue
* #FFD700 - gold
* #F0F8FF - alice blue

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<b>Deployed website would not function - </b> Issue with relative & absolute file path for javascript file "app.js", would work with gitpod website preview using:
<script src="assets/app.js"></script>  

but would not function on deployed website. For javascript file to load correctly I changed to absolute file path  
<script src="/rockpaperscissors---P2/assets/app.js"></script>
<hr>
<b>Issue with gameOver function - </b> I had issues with getting game to stop when user or computer reached max_points (set to 10 in this example).I overcame this by setting a variable as "let isGameover = false;". Then adding isGameOver function into the game() function. So if isGameOver function is false then play the game. Within the game function the gameOver function was included to run with statements defined within the function gameOver() with an else if statement. These determined the conditions for who won, the user or computer or if the game was drawn. The code was executed if the conditions were true, i.e.
<br>
if(userScore === max_points && computerScore < max_points){<br>
alert('You WON the game!! Congrats!');<br>
userScore = 0;<br>
computerScore = 0;<br>
isGameOver = true;<br>

<hr>
<b>Restart button only appearing when game was over - </b> I initially had this as display:none within CSS but this did not work. I overcame this issue by including CSS styling rules within the gameOver function: 
<p>if(isGameOver){ <br>
        restart.style.display = 'flex';<br>
    }<br>
    else {<br>
        restart.style.display = "none";<br>
    }<br>

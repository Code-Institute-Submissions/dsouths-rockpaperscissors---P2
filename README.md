<h2>Intro</h2>
I have created a Rock Paper Scissors game which utilizes HTML & CSS, with the main purpose of the project to showcase the skills I have learned in the latest Code Institute module, Javascript. The game pits the user/player against the computer in a game of chance. The site's goal is to create a challenging game for the player while entertaining them online. 

<h3>The Rules:</h3>

The user chooses one of three options (Rock, Paper or Scissors) & this choice is compared against the computers choice. 

* <b>Rock</b> beats <b>Scissors</b>
* <b>Paper</b> beats <b>Rock</b>
* <b>Scissors</b> beats <b>Paper</b>

The user/computer increments by 1 each time they win & does not increment if they draw or lose a game. 

<h2>Features</h2>
I plan to include the following features:

  * Pattern matching functionality
  * A limited number of tries before the game is over
  * A score tracking system
  * The ability to play against the computer
 
<h2>UX</h2>
 
I plan to incorporate the following into the user experience:

 * a game that is easy to understand, intuative & entertaining for the user
 * pit the user against the computer
 * make the game visually appealing to the user with complimentary colors, icons/emojis & call to actions
 * the game should work without any bugs or faults  

<h2>Fonts</h2>

I used [<b>Google Fonts</b>](https://fonts.google.com/) as it has a vast amount of modern & contemporary fonts. The two fonts I have used are Hind Siligur & Rubik, I felt these fonts complimented each other, where clean & modern & easily readible for the user. 

<h2>Icons</h2>

I have used a favicon from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

I wanted to make the website visually appealing to the user so decided to use emojis for the selection buttons; 

* Rock ‚úä  
* Paper ‚úã  
* Scissors ‚úåÔ∏è

I used a smiling emoji (üòÅ) when the user wins & a crying emoji (üò≠) in the result description when the user loses, to add to the visual experience of the user. These were sourced from [GetEmoji](https://getemoji.com/)   

<h2>Design</h2>

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to get a complimentary color palette to add to the visual experience of the user. I used the following:

* #05445E - very dark blue
* #FFD700 - gold
* #F0F8FF - alice blue
